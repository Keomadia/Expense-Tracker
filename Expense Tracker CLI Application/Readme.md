Here's a fun Python project you can build in 3 hours:

### **Project: Expense Tracker CLI Application**

#### **Overview:**
Build a command-line interface (CLI) tool to track personal expenses. The tool allows users to add, view, and categorize their expenses. This project will help you practice file handling, basic data structures, and user interaction via the terminal.

#### **Features:**
1. **Add an Expense:**
   - Input: Amount, category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment), and a short description.
   - Store the expense in a file (e.g., `expenses.csv`).
   
2. **View All Expenses:**
   - Display all expenses stored in the file in a table format.
   - Show total expenses for each category and the overall total.

3. **View by Category:**
   - Filter expenses based on a specific category.

4. **Delete an Expense (optional):**
   - Add a feature to remove an expense by specifying its ID or index.

#### **Technologies to Use:**
- Python built-in libraries: `csv` for file handling.
- Use of loops, conditional statements, and functions for structuring the code.

#### **Suggested Steps:**

1. **File Setup:**
   - Create a CSV file where expenses will be stored.
   - Define columns such as `Date`, `Amount`, `Category`, `Description`.

2. **Basic CLI Structure:**
   - Set up command-line arguments using `argparse` for actions like adding an expense, viewing all expenses, and filtering by category.

3. **Expense Addition:**
   - Write a function to add an expense to the CSV file.
   - Prompt the user for necessary inputs (amount, category, description) and add the current date.

4. **View Expenses:**
   - Write a function to read from the CSV file and print all the expenses in a readable table format.
   - Sum up the expenses for each category and the total.

5. **Extra Features (if time permits):**
   - Add a feature to delete or edit an existing expense.
   - Calculate and display the percentage of total expenses spent on each category.

This project is simple enough to complete in 3 hours but has plenty of room for extra features if you have additional time!
